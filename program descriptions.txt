This repository holds programming examples for .NET.  These examples were inspired using the labs and examples from the book
'Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 Application Development Foundation Self Paced Training Kit' by Tony Northrup and Shawn Wildermuth.  

Copy the associated folders to use the programs

A few things to note -
1) Some of these chapters required use of the CD in the book which I did not use, so in those labs I coded something similar myself.
Also some of these concepts were deprecated or no longer used with later versions of the .NET Framework.  In those cases, I researched
new ways of accomplishing similar tasks.  

2) In some of the earlier chapters, I was using Microsoft Visual Stuidio 2019, but most of my coding was done in Microsfoft Visual 
Studio 2017.  I will annotate these below.

3) Some of these also included some extra heavy commenting. This was done originally as notes for myself.  These files are in their original form
and I did not remove any of my comments.

4) I also threw in my C# Ultimate Cheatsheet and Regular Expression Notes.

5) * means that I did mostly my own research and coding or it is a particularly interesting project to me
